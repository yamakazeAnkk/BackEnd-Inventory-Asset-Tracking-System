### Architecture Overview

The system follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (Controllers)**
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Input validation
   - Authentication and authorization

2. **Business Layer (Services)**
   - Implements business logic
   - Handles transactions
   - Coordinates between different components

3. **Data Access Layer (Repositories)**
   - Manages database operations
   - Implements CRUD operations
   - Handles data persistence

4. **Domain Layer (Models)**
   - Contains business entities
   - Defines data transfer objects (DTOs)
   - Implements domain logic
